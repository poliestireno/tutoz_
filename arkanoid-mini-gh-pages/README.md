# Arkanoid-mini
a JavaScript game tribute by [nightcoder](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2)

PLAY [HERE](https://newnightcoder.github.io/arkanoid-mini/) (the game also has sounds/music)


This mini ballbreaker browser game was made with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. It is my very 1st programming project ever!!
I did it as part of round 1 of #100DaysOfCode, my journey to become a good frontend (or game?) developer ;)


So i got introduced to JavaScript thanks to this game project that i "built" from scratch, starting by learning :

- how to draw a simple rectangle or circle
- animation
- DOM manipulation!
- concept of (game) states! and the programming logic in general
- html/css/JS working together

My learning of JS continues!
More to come in 2020...

Enjoy the game!
